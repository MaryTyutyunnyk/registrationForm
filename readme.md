The task: Make the HTML page from the PSD layout. 

Technical requirements:
- The background image should be stretched to full screen regardless of the size of the screen, with all proportions.
- The top bar with icons should have transparency, as on the layout.
- All icons in the header should be made using sprites.
- The login form should be in the center of the page horizontally and vertically, regardless of the screen size (vertically - minus the height of the header).
- Login buttons via Google and Facebook must be manually created, not a picture.
- Fields for entering text should be highlighted as the first field on the layout when you click on them with the mouse cursor (not on the cover), while the user enters the text in this field.
- The checkbox should also be marked when clicking on the text next to it.
- Add transition for hover
